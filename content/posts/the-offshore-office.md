title = 'The Offshore Office'
+++

I've been working on this idea of an offshore office as an exercise in digital preparedness.

It's inspired by the many friends and aquantences in my life that have escaped existential crises in their home country only to struggle to make a living once they've left.

It's a place where I could quickly resume making a living for my family if there was an emergency situation where I currently live.

Most techie's like me only need a laptop to work. But that's not actually true to a certain extent.

When I am working in a place for an extended period of time, I want a few more things than my laptop

1. Large monitor
1. External keyboard and mouse
1. All the right dongles
1. UPS
1. Headphones, webcam and mic
1. Nice desk and chair
1. NAS with all my most important files
1. Printer and Scanner
1. Network equiptment like router, AP and firewall 

I also use several laptops for different jobs.

The central idea behind this exercise is can I leave everything and travel to this remote location and be fine to continue working or look for a new job.
