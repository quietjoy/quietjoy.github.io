The boomer doomers have it wrong when it comes to survival skills.

Their heads are filled with visions a rugged escape into the wilderness — armed with a rifle, a bag of beans and a compass.

If you ever meet someone whose fled an existential conflict that has ripped their country or region apart, the don't want a bag of dried beans.

They would have rather had an overseas apartment, foreign bank account and second passport.

For the vast majority of us, if the world is bad enough that the combines in Idaho are off, then 

This is in addition to the immediate need to bring home the bacon.

Over the past year I’ve been reflecting on how powerful a survival skill entrepreneurship is, perhaps the ultimate survival skill. I often wonder if I were to arrive in a new country with little money and few connections, would I have the resilience and creativity to build a sustainable business?

It’s clear there’s an opportunity—and perhaps a necessity—to begin preparing for such a scenario. I’ve decided to take this challenge as a personal exercise in readiness. What kind of business would I try to start? What would I want waiting for me if I had to do this? 

    • Tools: The necessary tools to launch and run a business.
    • Wealth: Accessible funds to kickstart and sustain the venture.
    • Network: A network of local people that I could leverage to get things running

In upcoming posts, I’ll begin to break apart how I’m beginning to prepare for such a situation and why. For now, I’ll leave some of the most personal details—such as the exact scenario and destination—undiscussed. They remain private, reserved for moments when the time truly calls for a change.
