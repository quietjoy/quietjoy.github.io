I’ll never forget the conversation I had with my wife’s grandmother about fleeing Cuba. When I asked what she took with her, she replied, “Other than my clothes, my jewelry and my cookbooks.” She took her wealth and a repository of knowledge—practical tools that could help care for her family in an entirely new life. Her husband ended up basically washing to shore in Puerto Rico with no money and no connections. He started a small coffee stand that provided for his family for the next 30 years. 

The boomer-doomers will fill your head with visions a rugged escape into the wilderness—armed with a rifle, a bag of beans, and a canister of propane—the reality for many that I’ve met is strikingly different. Of the people I’ve met who have fled conflict or oppressive governments, it seems they would have rather had an overseas apartment, foreign bank account and second passport rather than a rifle, beans and propane. This is in addition to the immediate need to bring home the bacon.

Over the past year I’ve been reflecting on how powerful a survival skill entrepreneurship is, perhaps the ultimate survival skill. I often wonder if I were to arrive in a new country with little money and few connections, would I have the resilience and creativity to build a sustainable business?

It’s clear there’s an opportunity—and perhaps a necessity—to begin preparing for such a scenario. I’ve decided to take this challenge as a personal exercise in readiness. What kind of business would I try to start? What would I want waiting for me if I had to do this? 

    • Tools: The necessary tools to launch and run a business.
    • Wealth: Accessible funds to kickstart and sustain the venture.
    • Network: A network of local people that I could leverage to get things running

In upcoming posts, I’ll begin to break apart how I’m beginning to prepare for such a situation and why. For now, I’ll leave some of the most personal details—such as the exact scenario and destination—undiscussed. They remain private, reserved for moments when the time truly calls for a change.
