### The Boomer Doomers Have It Wrong About Survival Skills

The average boomer doomer imagines survival as a rugged escape into the wilderness—riding out an instant, indefinite power outage, nestled safely in a bugout cabin.

And they *will* shoot you if you get too close.

Books like *One Second After* obsess over how fragile our world is due to its reliance on technology and our lack of wilderness survival skills.

And while I genuinely enjoy these books, reality is often different story. 

Talk to people who’ve actually lived through existential crises. They’re not after your dried beans.

They *really* would have liked to have an overseas apartment in a stable country, a foreign bank account and a second passport.

I once asked a woman who had fled the total collapse of her country what she brought with her.  

> “Besides my clothes,” she said, “my jewelry and my cookbooks.”

Do any of the YouTube go-bag tutorials mention cookbooks?

That same woman’s husband went on to start a small business in a brand-new country, with no connections and no money—yet that business sustained their family for years.

It wasn’t farming skills or an expert-level water purification setup that got them through.

It was:

- Portable wealth
- A sense of home
- And the ability to bring home the bacon with next to nothing

### Entrepreneurship Is Everywhere, All the Time

Even in the most communist or authoritarian countries—where profit is essentially outlawed—you’ll find people turning a profit.

An Uzbek friend once told me about his grandfather, who endured several stints in prison for fixing up old cars and selling them to feed the family.

Or my Belarusian friend, who fled to Ukraine just before the war, bought an apartment, had it bombed, and now has to perpetually travel because of a bad passport.  

And still *still* he finds ways to support his family.

This is common sense to most immigrants. You wash up in a new place and figure it out. You hustle because you have no other choice.

But in most “survival” circles, you rarely hear about this.  

Why? Because it doesn’t fit the usual doomsday fantasy template.

### But Can You Prep for Extreme Entrepreneurship?

Over the past year, I’ve been reflecting on how entrepreneurship might be the *ultimate* survival skill.

I often wonder: if I landed in a new country with little money and zero connections, would I have the resilience and creativity to build something sustainable?

More and more, I think the answer lies in *preparing* for that scenario—not just physically, but mentally and logistically.

So I’ve decided to take on this challenge as a personal exercise in readiness.

What kind of business would I try to start?  
What would I want waiting for me if I had to begin again from scratch?  
What skills would I need?

Here’s what I’m thinking:

- **Tools**: The basic hardware and software to launch something fast  
- **Wealth**: Accessible, portable funds to kick things off  
- **Network**: At least a few local connections I can lean on
- **Skills**: Things that can make money almost anywhere 

In upcoming posts, I’ll break down how I’m beginning to prepare for this kind of scenario—and why I believe more people should be doing the same.
